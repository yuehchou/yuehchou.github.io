Here are five tips that can help you operate Linux system more easily and conveniently.<br>

1. You can use the <b>clear</b> command to clear the terminal if it gets filled up with too many commands.<br>

2. <b>TAB</b> can be used to fill up in terminal. For example, You just need to type <b>"cd Doc"</b> and then TAB and the terminal fills the rest up and makes it <b>"cd Documents"</b>.<br>

3. <b>Ctrl+C</b> can be used to stop any command in terminal safely. If it doesn't stop with that, then <b>Ctrl+Z</b> can be used to force stop it.<br>

4. You can exit from the terminal by using the <b>"exit"</b> command.<br>

5. You can power off or reboot the computer by using the command <b>"sudo halt"</b> and <b>"sudo reboot"</b>.<br>
